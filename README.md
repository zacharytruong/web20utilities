# Side Web 2.0 XML Generator

In-progress project.

The web app will help generate the import XML file for **Side web 2.0**. The XML currently allows users to import the following custom post types (CPT):
1. Members (Team Member)
2. Member-profiles (CAPP)

Future plan:
* More in-depth ‘members’ input.
* More in-depth ‘member-profiles’ input.
* Community details generator.
* Retrieve ‘members’ data directly from SFDC.
